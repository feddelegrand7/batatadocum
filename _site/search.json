Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\r\nEnforcement\r\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\r\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\r\nEnforcement Guidelines\r\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\r\n1. Correction\r\nCommunity Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\r\nConsequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\r\n2. Warning\r\nCommunity Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\r\nConsequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\r\n4. Permanent Ban\r\nCommunity Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\r\nConsequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.\r\nAttribution\r\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/ code_of_conduct.html.\r\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by Mozilla’s code of conduct enforcement ladder.\r\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

Defaults to 5, in which case the function will look for the last 5 starred repositories, filter R from non-R repos and install them if available on CRAN.\r\nExample The following code chunk will look at the last 10 repositories that I have starred, filter out R repositories, and install them if available on CRAN:\r\n\r\n\r\n# my Github user name is 'feddelegrand7'\r\ninstall_starred_cran(github_user = 'feddelegrand7', n = 10)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that if the starred repo is not available on CRAN, install_starred_cran() will simply ignore it.\r\ninstall_starred_github()\r\nDescription install_starred_github() behaves the same way as install_starred_cran() except that it will install the repositories from Github (not from CRAN), so that you can install packages that are not available on CRAN.\r\nParameters\r\ngithub_user (str): the Github user name to look for\r\nn (num): the last n starred repositories. Defaults to 5, in which case the function will look for the last 5 starred repositories, filter R from non-R repos and install them\r\nupgrade (str): whether to upgrade or not out of date packages. You can choose from ‘always’ or ‘never’. Defaults to ‘never’. For more info, see install_github() from the remote package.\r\nExample The following code chunk will look at the last five repositories that I have starred, extract R repositories (in case some starred repositories belong to another programming language) and install them:\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall_starred_github(github_user = 'feddelegrand7', \r\n                       n = 5, \r\n                       upgrade = \"never\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall_most_starred()\r\nDescription Allows you the install the most starred CRAN packages that are available on Github. It takes one argument n which specifies the number of the most starred R packages (in descending order) that one wants to install.\r\nParameters\r\nn: the number of most starred CRAN packages (in descending order). Defaults to 10, in which case the function will look at the 10 most starred R repositories and install them if available on CRAN.\r\nExample The following code chunk will look for the 10 most starred R repositories and will install them if available on CRAN. Of course, it will ignore R repositories that are not packages, (e.g R4DS repo):\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall_most_starred(n = 10)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
